            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8">
                Before you can exploit a player, you must accurately categorize them. This module teaches you to read statistics (online) and observe tendencies (live) to build a robust player profile.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mb-4">1.1 Core Statistics and Their Meaning</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-6">
                These three stats form the foundation of most online (HUD) and live reads:

                <li><strong class="content-bold">VPIP (Voluntarily Put in Pot):</strong> How often a player invests money pre-flop, beyond the Big Blind. (Normal GTO range: $20\%-30\%$ for a full ring, $35\%-50\%$ for $6$-max).</li>
                <li><strong class="content-bold">PFR (Pre-Flop Raise):</strong> How often a player raises pre-flop. (A large gap between VPIP and PFR suggests a "Limping Fish").</li>
                <li><strong class="content-bold">3-Bet Frequency:</strong> How often a player re-raises. (Low suggests they only $3$-bet the nuts; high suggests an aggressive player).</li>

                <p class="text-gray-300">
                    In a live game, high VPIP players are easy to spot: they are constantly checking their cards, folding rarely, and often buying back in. Low VPIP players ("Nits") are often reading, looking at their phone, or waiting patiently for strong hands.

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8">
                Forget your GTO $V:B$ ratios. This is about making a specific player feel uncomfortable until they pay you off.

            <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mb-4">2.1 Countering the Nit (The Over-Folder)</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                The Nit's main leak is that they fold far too often to aggression. You combat this by increasing your aggression and decreasing your required equity.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 space-y-3 mb-8">
                <li><strong class="content-bold">Triple Barrel Frequency:</strong> Increase your pure bluff triple-barrel frequency from $1:1$ to $0.7:1$ ($V:B$) because their river calling range is heavily condensed to the absolute nuts.</li>
                <li><strong class="content-bold">Small Sizing Abuse:</strong> Use <strong class="content-bold">$25\%$ pot sizing</strong> on the flop and turn with $100\%$ of your air. The small bet is low-risk, and their high fold frequency makes it instantly profitable.</li>
                <li><strong class="content-bold">Check-Behind:</strong> If you check-behind the flop with a mid-strength hand (like middle pair), you avoid putting money in when they raise, and you get a free card.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mb-4 mt-8">2.2 Countering the Calling Station (The Under-Folder)</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                The Calling Station's leak is their inability to fold marginal hands. You punish this by removing bluffs entirely and betting for value at every opportunity.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 space-y-3 mb-8">
                <li><strong class="content-bold">Eliminate Bluffs:</strong> If they call with worse than Top Pair/Weak Kicker, you should simply check or give up on all your draws and air. You need a showdown-worthy hand to put money into the pot.</li>
                <li><strong class="content-bold">Value Bet Thin:</strong> Bet hands that GTO would check, such as <strong class="content-bold">Third Pair</strong> on the river or marginal Top Pair. Their calling range is so wide that these hands become value bets.</li>
                <li><strong class="content-bold">Overbet for Value:</strong> Use <strong class="content-bold">$150\%$ to $200\%$ pot sizing</strong> when you have the nuts or near-nuts. The Calling Station's psychology makes them think a big bet means you're bluffing or trying to "buy" the pot, and they will call bigger than they should.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                The Maniac applies too much pressure, which is uncomfortable but profitable if you adjust correctly.

                <li><strong class="content-bold">Wider Call/4-Bet Pre-Flop:</strong> Open your calling and $4$-betting ranges to defend against their wide $3$-betting. Call with marginal hands like $A-T\text{ offsuit}$ or $K-J\text{ suited}$ to play post-flop in position.</li>
                <li><strong class="content-bold">Trap/Slow-Play:</strong> Maniacs love to bet into you. Check-call or check-raise with <strong class="content-bold">very strong hands</strong> (Sets, Two Pair) to let them continue barreling into you with their air. Do not bet out on the flop or turn when you have the nuts.</li>
                <li><strong class="content-bold">Bluff-Catching:</strong> Develop an excellent bluff-catching range on the river, calling down with strong pairs or even Ace-high when the board is connected, as their range contains significantly more bluffs than value hands.</li>

            <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mb-4 mt-10">3.2 Utilizing Stack Management and Sizing</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                How a player organizes and bets their chips reveals intent:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 space-y-3">
                <li><strong class="content-bold">The Chip Splash:</strong> Throwing chips haphazardly into the pot (a "splashy" bet) is almost always a bluff or a thin value bet disguised as confidence. Genuine value bets are often counted and placed neatly.</li>
                <li><strong class="content-bold">Tower Stacks:</strong> Players who build large, towering stacks are often trying to look aggressive or intimidate. Exploit them by calling light, as they want to avoid a showdown.</li>
                <li><strong class="content-bold">The Chip Check:</strong> A player who stares intently at your stack *before* betting, especially on the river, is likely gauging how much they need to bet to get a fold. This often signifies a polarized range (nuts or pure bluff).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mb-4 mt-10">3.3 Table Image and Psychological Warfare</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-400">
                Manage how you appear to the table. This is your most powerful meta-game tool.

                <li><strong class="content-bold">The Tight Image:</strong> If you play tight for $30$ minutes, your first large bluff will be highly effective because the table perceives you as a nit (i.e., you're abusing your image).</li>
                <li><strong class="content-bold">The Maniac Image:</strong> If you show a few bluffs early, the table will start calling you down with marginal hands. This is the perfect time to switch and start <strong class="content-bold">value-betting thinner</strong> than ever before, as you've convinced them you always bluff.</li>
