            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
                Profitability starts with understanding the numbers. We move beyond simple intuition to calculate profitability using equity, odds, and expected value. This module turns guesswork into a <strong>rigorous, long-term profitable</strong> system.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mb-4">1.1 Hand Equity, Outs, and the 4 & 2 Rule</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                <strong>Equity</strong> is your fair share of the pot. An <strong>Out</strong> is any card that will improve your hand to be the likely winner. The <strong>4 and 2 Rule</strong> is a quick mental shortcut to estimate your hand equity when on a draw. You multiply your outs by 4 after the flop (2 cards to come) and by 2 after the turn (1 card to come).
            </p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>FUN FACT:</strong> The "4 and 2 Rule" is a slight simplification. The true probability of hitting your draw from the flop to the river is always slightly lower than the result of (Outs &times; 4). For instance, a 9-out flush draw is closer to <strong>35%</strong> than 36%.
            </div>

            <p class="text-white font-bold mb-2">Example Outs Estimates (4 & 2 Rule):</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-300 space-y-1 mb-6">
                <li>Flush Draw (9 outs): 9 &times; 4 &approx; <strong>36%</strong> (Flop to River)</li>
                <li>Open-Ended Straight Draw (8 outs): 8 &times; 4 &approx; <strong>32%</strong> (Flop to River)</li>
                <li>Gutshot Straight Draw (4 outs): 4 &times; 4 &approx; <strong>16%</strong> (Flop to River)</li>
                <li>Combo Draw (Flush + OESD, 15 outs): 15 &times; 4 &approx; <strong>60%</strong> (Flop to River)</li>

            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                <strong>Pot Odds</strong> are the ratio of what you must call to the total size of the pot you are trying to win (including your call). This determines the minimum frequency (<strong>required equity</strong>) you must win to break even on the call. Understanding this is the <strong>single most important foundational math skill</strong> for any beginner.
                <br>
                For example: If you call <strong>$25</strong> to win a total pot of <strong>$100</strong>, your required equity is $25 / $100 = <strong>25%</strong>. If your hand has <strong>more than 25% equity</strong>, calling is profitable.
            </p>
            <!-- Image for 1.2: Pot odds visual --><img src="course101image2.jpg" alt="Pot odds visual" class="course-image">
            <!-- PROMPT for course101image2.jpg: A graphic showing a poker table with stacks of chips representing a pot. Clearly label the "Call Amount" and "Total Pot" with a percentage calculation for "Required Equity."

            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                The most sophisticated players factor in money that is *not yet* in the pot (<strong>Implied Odds</strong>) or money they might *lose* later (<strong>Reverse Implied Odds</strong>). These considerations allow you to make calls with draws that are technically <strong>-EV</strong> based on pure pot odds alone.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Implied Odds:</strong> When drawing, you have good implied odds if you believe your opponent will pay off a big bet when you hit your monster (e.g., hitting a flush with an opponent who never folds). This justifies calling even if pure pot odds are slightly negative. Seek <strong>deep-stacked opponents</strong> with wide calling ranges.</li>
                <li><strong>Reverse Implied Odds:</strong> Occur when you make a thin call and hit a hand that is likely second-best (e.g., calling with $J7$ and hitting a $J$, only to lose a big pot to $AJ$ or $KJ$). These hands should be avoided because they cost more money when they hit than when they miss. This is why you must <strong>avoid playing hands like J9o or KTo</strong> from early position.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Image for 1.3: Implied vs Reverse Implied Odds Concept --><img src="course101image3.jpg" alt="Implied vs Reverse Implied Odds Concept" class="course-image">

Use subtle arrows and money metaphors. Dark, strategic poker feel. --><h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mb-4 mt-8">1.4 Introduction to Expected Value (EV)</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                <strong>Expected Value (EV)</strong> is the average profit or loss you expect to make from a decision if you repeat it an infinite number of times. Our entire goal is to <strong>maximize positive EV decisions</strong>. This concept allows us to make plays that *lose* sometimes, but are still profitable in the long run.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-400">
                In simple terms, an action has a positive EV if the total amount of money you win over time (weighted by the probability of winning) exceeds the total amount of money you lose over time (weighted by the probability of losing).
            </p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>TIP:</strong> The ultimate positive EV decision is <strong>folding</strong> when you know you're behind. Saving money by folding bad hands is just as profitable as winning a big pot.

                We are building a <strong>Tight, Aggressive (TAG)</strong> strategy by using GTO-based ranges. <strong>GTO (Game Theory Optimal)</strong> means you are playing a strategy that is unexploitable by any opponent, ensuring you are never the target of aggression.

            <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mb-4">2.1 Positional Play: Rationale and RFI Ranges</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                Never limp. The size of your Raise First In (<strong>RFI</strong>) should be consistent: <strong>3x BB</strong> in early/mid position, and <strong>2.5x BB</strong> in the Cut-Off (CO) or Button (BTN). <strong>Position is Power</strong>. You should play a much wider range of hands in late position (CO, BTN) because you get to act last on all post-flop streets, which is a massive information advantage.

            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                A <strong>3-Bet</strong> is re-raising an open raise. Your 3-betting range should be <strong>Polarized</strong> from the Blinds (SB/BB), meaning it contains your best hands (AA, KK, AK) and your best bluffs (hands with good equity that block your opponent's best hands, like A5s). A polarized range makes it difficult for your opponent to know if you're raising for <strong>value or a bluff</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Value Hands (Top):</strong> AA, KK, QQ, AK. These are for <strong>maximum profit</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Bluff Hands (Bottom):</strong> Suited A-X (A5s-A2s) and suited connectors (87s, 76s, 65s). These have great playability if called and <strong>block opponent's premium hands</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>DEFINITION:</strong> A <strong>Blocker</strong> is a card you hold that is necessary for your opponent to have a strong hand. For instance, holding the Ace of spades reduces the number of combinations of Aces your opponent can have. This is an advanced concept crucial for balancing 3-bet bluffs.

            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                <strong>Cold calling</strong> (simply calling a raise when you haven't put money in yet) is a leak if done too often, as it surrenders the initiative. You should primarily defend your <strong>Big Blind (BB)</strong> because of the <strong>excellent pot odds</strong> you are getting.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4 border-l-4 border-gray-600 pl-4 py-2">
                <strong>BB Defense:</strong> When facing a 3x BB open, you only need ~25% equity to call. You can defend an extremely wide range (<strong>up to 70% of hands!</strong>) against a late-position raise, favoring hands that realize equity well (suited hands, pairs, broadways). Never fold an entire suited hand range!

            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                A <strong>C-Bet</strong> is a bet made on the flop by the player who was the pre-flop aggressor. We C-Bet for two primary reasons: <strong>protection/value</strong> (with strong hands) and <strong>bluffing</strong> (with draws or weak hands that have little Showdown Value).
            </p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>TIP:</strong> The optimal <strong>C-Bet frequency</strong> should be high (60-80%) on boards that favor your pre-flop range (e.g., A-high, K-high boards) and much lower (40-50%) on boards that hit the Big Blind's cold-calling range better (e.g., T98, 765 suited boards).

                <li><strong>Large Bet Sizing (75% - 100% Pot):</strong> Used on boards that dramatically favor your range (e.g., a dry A-high board when you have all the AA/AK combinations). This communicates a <strong>Polarized Range</strong>â€”either a monster or a pure bluff.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                <strong>Barreling</strong> is betting again on the turn (double) or river (triple) after a C-Bet on the flop. Barrels are effective bluffs because they exploit an opponent's tendency to fold to repeated aggression.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Turn Barrel (Double):</strong> Best used when a card changes the board texture favorably (e.g., a flush draw completes, or a high card gives you more top pairs). Use hands with <strong>high equity</strong> or good <strong>blockers</strong> for bluffs.</li>
                <li><strong>River Barrel (Triple):</strong> This is your <strong>highest-risk, highest-reward</strong> move. Only use it as a bluff with hands that have <strong>zero showdown value</strong> (e.g., failed flush draw) but have excellent blockers. If you get called here, you lose the whole pot.</li>
            </ul>

                Technical skill is useless without discipline. This module covers the financial and psychological frameworks for long-term survival. <strong>Bankroll Management (BRM)</strong> is the financial discipline that keeps you in the game during inevitable downswings.

                <strong>Variance</strong> is higher in tournaments, requiring a deeper bankroll. A <strong>Buy-in (BI)</strong> is the max amount you bring to the table (usually 100 big blinds) or the cost of a tournament ticket.

                <strong>The Iron Rule:</strong> If your bankroll requires you to move down, <strong>do it immediately</strong> without question. This is the difference between surviving a downswing and going broke. <strong>Never</strong> play outside your BRM rules.

            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                Your skill only accounts for half your win rate; <strong>Game Selection</strong> accounts for the other half. The goal is to always play with <strong>worse players</strong> than yourself. This is known as "table selection" and is critical for maximizing hourly win-rate.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Look for the Fish:</strong> Identify loose, passive players (<strong>VPIP > 30%</strong>) or those making fundamental errors (limping, calling too much, checking too often). These are your primary source of profit.</li>
                <li><strong>Target Position:</strong> Position yourself immediately to the <strong>left</strong> of the weakest player to gain position on them most often.</li>
                <li><strong>Table Leave Rule:</strong> If you lose a large pot to a bad player, <strong>stay</strong>. They will make more mistakes. If you lose a large pot to a good player who is crushing you, <strong>leave immediately</strong>.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                <strong>Tilt</strong> is playing sub-optimally due to emotional distress (anger, frustration, fear). It is the single largest leak for winning players. <strong>Protecting your mental game</strong> is the key to consistency.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white font-bold mb-2">The 5 R's of Emotional Control:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Recognize:</strong> Identify the physical and mental signs of tilt (rapid heart rate, shallow breathing, desire to "get back" losses).</li>
                <li><strong>Refocus:</strong> Remind yourself of your pre-defined, optimal strategy (your charts and math rules).</li>
                <li><strong>Respond:</strong> Take a short break (5 minutes). Get water, stretch, or step away from the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Review:</strong> Objectively analyze the hand that caused the tilt (Was it a <strong>bad play</strong> or <strong>bad luck</strong>?).</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Commit to returning to your A-Game. If you can't, use your <strong>Stop-Loss Rule</strong> and end the session.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>FUN FACT:</strong> The term "Tilt" originated from pinball machines. When a player shook the machine too hard, the game would flash "TILT," freezing the flippers and preventing the player from continuing, which is exactly what emotional distress does to your poker decision-making process.
